While I've always appreciated beautiful code, I share Jonathan's concern
about studying it too much. I think studying beauty in music and
painting has led us to modern classical music and painting that the
majority of us just don't get. Beauty can be seen when it emerges, but
isn't something to strive for in isolation of a larger context. In the
software world, the larger context would be the utility of the software
to the end user.
