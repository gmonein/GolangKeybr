To solve your problems you must learn new skills, adapt new thought
patterns, and become a different person than you were before that
problem.  God has crafted you for success. In the middle of every
adversity lie your best opportunities. Discover it, build upon it and
move forward in your journey to live an extraordinary life.  You owe it
to yourself to live a great life. Don't let negative thoughts pull you
down. Be grateful and open to learn and grow.
