Getting back to failing early, I've learned it's important to completely
fail. Get fired. Shoot the project, then burn its corpse. Melt the CVS
repository and microwave the backup CDs. When things go wrong, I've
often tried to play the hero from start to finish. Guess what? Some
projects are doomed no matter what. Some need skills I don't possess.
And some need a fresh face.
